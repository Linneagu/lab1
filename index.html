I'm a curious and creative person who loves solving problems through thoughtgful design. My strenghts lie in understanding user needs, paying attention to details, and turning complex ideas into clear and intuitive solutions.

            <p>I was born and raised in a small town in Småland, and when I was 11 years old my family had to move to Halmstad. It's a moment I remember very clearly in many different ways. I grew up in a house with a large garden, and suddenly we were moving to a much bigger city and into an apartment right in the city center. It was a bog change that felt both difficult and exciting. I ended up living in Halmstad unbtil I was 26 years old, when I deceided to move to Kalmar where I currently live. </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <main>
           <p>I've alwats been a very creative person, and as a child I loved crafting and making things by hand. That interest later grew into a passion for photography and photo editing. I studied media with focus on photography in gymnasiet, wich gave me even more opportunities to express my creativity. When I started working after school, I realized that I really missed having a creative element in my daily life. After moving to Kalmar, I discovered the Interaction design program at Linneus University, and it felt like the perfect fit for me. Interaction design also feels very relevant today, it allows you to create meningful and accessible design that makes life easier for users and that works for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Future goals</h2>
        <main>
            <p>One of my future goals is to work as an Interaction designer focusing on creating accessible and inclusive design experiences. Accessibility is imoprtant to me because good design should work for everyone, regardless of their abilities, background, or level of technical experience. I want to be part of creating solutions that makes everyday life easier and more intuitive for all users.</p>
